The Breeder Genomics Hub is a customized [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) that bundles bioinformatics software useful for plant breeders and scientists. It enables research labs to make use of an existing Linux server with Docker support to serve a JupyterHub alongside other containers they may already be running. It is ideal for small groups looking to provide a reproducible computational environment for scientific analysis to their members and collaborators.
