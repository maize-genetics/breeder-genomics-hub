# Included Software
The Breeder Genomics Hub uses the [breeder-notebook](https://github.com/maize-genetics/breeder-notebook) as its base environment for all users. A nonexhaustive list of bundled software is included below.

The notebook environment and its associated software is a community endeavor, so if there's something that you think should be included, please [open an issue](https://github.com/maize-genetics/breeder-notebook/issues/new/choose) on the breeder-notebook GitHub repository.

## Buckler Lab Software
Software developed by members of the [Buckler Lab](https://maizegenetics.net):
* [TASSEL](https://tassel.bitbucket.io/)
* The [Practical Haplotype Graph](https://www.maizegenetics.net/phg)
* [rTASSEL](https://rtassel.maizegenetics.net/) and [rPHG](https://rphg.maizegenetics.net/)

## Innovation Lab for Crop Improvement
Software developed by members of the [Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Crop Improvement](https://ilci.cornell.edu/):
* [BrAPI](https://brapi.org/) Helper JupyterLab extension that provides GUI for managing database connections to breeding management systems (e.g. [BMS](https://integratedbreeding.net/), [BreedBase](https://breedbase.org/), [GIGWA](https://gigwa.southgreen.fr/gigwa/))
* [Notebook templates](https://github.com/agostof/ILCI-NotebookTemplates) (using [JupyterLab Templates](https://github.com/finos/jupyterlab_templates)) providing instruction on common bioinformatics and data science pipelines for breeders

## Common Bioinformatics Tools
* [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2)
* [samtools & bcftools](http://www.htslib.org/)
* [bwa (Burrow-Wheeler Aligner)](https://github.com/lh3/bwa)

## Programming Languages
The JupyterLab environment comes with [kernels](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/projects/kernels.html) for the following:
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
